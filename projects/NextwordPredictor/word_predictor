I developed a Next Word Predictor using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, leveraging a
Sequential neural network architecture with an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) layer to effectively
capture contextual word dependencies in text. The model utilizes word embeddings to convert textual input
into dense vector representations that preserve semantic meaning. It is trained using the Adam optimizer,
which helps in faster convergence and efficient gradient-based optimization. The system learns from input
sequences and predicts the most probable next word, making it useful for applications such as auto-
completion and smart text suggestion. This project demonstrates the practical implementation of deep
learning in NLP, focusing on language modeling and sequence prediction.
